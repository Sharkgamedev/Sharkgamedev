## You made this README?
#### Nope! Not at all. I wasn't actually going to make a README for my profile - It seemed like a waste of time, a fun waste of time, but still a waste of time. That is until I saw the amazing [vn7n24fzkq's](https://github.com/vn7n24fzkq/github-profile-summary-cards-example) profile card generator, and figured why not. So long answer is this is an auto generated profile using the soley vn7n24fzkq's code, with absolutely no modifications. This was all them. Thanks vn7n24fzkq!
